OGC Standards Documents do not contain normative schemas but instead reference them (such as in the OGC schema repository). Therefore, schema references are normative and reference is by namespace and location. All examples of schema use in an OGC standards document are informative and should labeled as examples. In the case of an inconsistency between the OGC standards document and the normative schema in the OGC repository, the schema in the repository takes precedence.
