Whenever possible and as appropriate, when naming an OGC Standard, try to work the name so that a three (3) or (4) letter acronym can be used to be a short-hand designation for that new standard. Examples are WMS for Web Map Service Implementation Standard and GML for Geography Markup Language. By way of guidance, many OGC web service interface standards begin with the letter “W” for Web and end in “S” for Service. If three or four letters does not work, then shorter or longer abbreviations are OK.  Examples of a shorter abbreviation is OM for Observations and Measurements (although O&M is also used) and netCDF is an example of a longer abbreviation. In all cases, please be consistent in all documentation and references to the standard.
