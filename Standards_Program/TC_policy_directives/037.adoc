The default for DWGs will be public (also known as “open”).

Explanatory text: all DWG activities settings such as access to e-mail lists, portal files, and meetings should initially be set to be public.  A DWG can vote to be closed, once established.

Existing closed DWGs shall be grandfathered at their current status and give six (6) months to object to being changed to public.

[NOTE]
Public DWGs by default are now codified in the TC Policies and Procedures section 4.2.1.
