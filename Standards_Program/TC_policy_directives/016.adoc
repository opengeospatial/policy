In addition to web services interfaces, work on API/interfaces for tightly coupled architectures is germane and valuable in terms of the work of the consortium.

Component Coupling [Software Architecture in Practice, By Len Bass, Paul Clements, Rick Kazman. Published by Addison Wesley Professional.

In a narrow sense, coupling refers to the way data is exchanged between components. Loose coupling is generally better than tight coupling. The loosest, and therefore preferred, type of coupling is data coupling, where data is transferred as parameters via well-defined interfaces. The tightest coupling involves components directly referencing shared variables. Tight coupling often indicates that components are not insulated from each other, and are not designed to be separate and independent. Tightly coupled components are usually complex, difficult to maintain, and monolithic. As a result there is very little flexibility regarding physical distribution of components. Two applications that communicate with each other via database management system (DBMS) updates, but which are otherwise independent of each other, would be considered loosely coupled.
