In July 2014, the OGC Members approved OGC 13-102r2 “Name Type Specification – Time and index coordinate reference system definitions” as an OGC Policy. This candidate policy specifies the rationales behind the construction and maintenance of time and index coordinate reference systems and their http URIs under OGC that may be used for encoding temporal or pure integral coordinates, respectively. Such coordinate reference systems could be compound with geospatial ones, to build spatiotemporal/ spatio-index geometric spaces.
